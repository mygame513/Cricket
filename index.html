<h1 style="color: red;">Why I should play cricket!</h1>
<p style="color: firebrick;">Hi Dad,

I wanted to talk to you about something important—joining a cricket club. As you know, I really enjoy playing cricket and have already picked up some experience. I feel like I’ve learned a lot just by playing casually, but I also know that to get better, I need to play regularly with others and be coached properly. A cricket club would give me that chance. I’d improve my skills, get to be part of a real team, and learn important things like teamwork, focus, and how to handle both success and failure—lessons that matter on and off the field.</p>

<p style="color: navy;">I also think being in a club would keep me active, give me a good routine, and give me something positive to work towards. I understand it takes time and commitment, and I promise I’ll keep up with school and other responsibilities. I’m ready to take it seriously and would be really grateful for the chance to give it a go. Thanks for always supporting me—I hope you’ll consider it.

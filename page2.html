<p style="color: green;">Cricket is the best game because it  combines <span style="color: red;">skill, strategy, and teamwork</span> in a way that few other sports can match. Whether it's the thrill of a powerful six, the precision of a perfect yorker, or the tension of a close run chase, cricket offers endless excitement. It brings people together, from backyards to stadiums, and teaches important life lessons like patience, discipline, and resilience. With different formats like Test matches, ODIs, and T20s, there's something for every kind of fan, making cricket a truly unique and universally loved sport.
